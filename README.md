- Animation utilities
- Responsive breakpoints

## 📊 Data Structure

The dashboard uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety:

```typescript
interface MetricCard {
  title: string;
  value: string | number;
  change: number;
  changeType: 'increase' | 'decrease';
  icon: string;
  format: 'currency' | 'number' | 'percentage';
}

interface CampaignData {
  id: string;
  campaignName: string;
  impressions: number;
  clicks: number;
  cpc: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  status: 'Live' | 'Paused' | 'Ended';
  type: 'Brand' | 'Performance' | 'Awareness';
  region: 'India' | 'US' | 'Europe' | 'Asia-Pacific';
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with zero configuration

### Netlify
1. Build the project: `pnpm build`
2. Deploy the `out` folder to Netlify

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN pnpm install
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

## 🛠️ Deployment Issues & Fixes

During the deployment process to Netlify, several technical issues were encountered and resolved:

![Deployment Errors](./errors.png)

### ⚠️ Issues Resolved:

1. **TypeScript Import Error in theme-provider.tsx**
   - **Issue**: `Cannot find module 'next-themes/dist/types'`
   - **Fix**: Replaced problematic import with `React.ComponentProps<typeof NextThemesProvider>`

2. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Node.js version 18.17.0 download failure on Netlify
   - **Fix**: Updated to stable LTS version 18.19.0 in both `.nvmrc` and `netlify.toml`

3. **Chart Component Type Errors**
   - **Issue**: Missing `payload` property in chart tooltip/legend components
   - **Fix**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces for Recharts components

4. **Mock Data Type Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: `ChartDataPoint` interface missing required `value` property in revenue data
   - **Fix**: Added `value` property to match interface requirements

### 📋 Configuration Files Added:
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
- `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification
- Updated `package.json` with engines field

### 🔧 Technical Debt Addressed:
- TypeScript strict type checking compliance
- Component prop type safety
- Build system optimization
- Dependency version alignment

**Note**: These deployment challenges required systematic debugging and precise TypeScript knowledge. Each issue was methodically identified through build logs and resolved with targeted fixes to ensure production deployment success.

## 🤖 AI Usage Report

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow

During the development of ADmyBRAND Insights, I leveraged AI assistance through GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to enhance productivity and code quality across multiple aspects of the project.

**Component Development (40% AI Assistance)**
AI significantly accelerated the creation of reusable UI components, particularly the complex chart components and data table implementation. Copilot provided intelligent auto-completion for TypeScript interfaces and React component patterns, reducing boilerplate code by approximately 60%. The AI assistance was particularly valuable in generating consistent prop types and ensuring type safety across the component library.

**Data Processing & Mock Data Generation (60% AI Assistance)**
The mock data generation functions in `lib/mockData.ts` were heavily AI-assisted. I provided the requirements for realistic campaign data, and AI helped generate comprehensive mock datasets with proper randomization algorithms for simulating real-time updates. This included creating realistic campaign names, performance metrics, and demographic distributions that closely mirror actual marketing analytics data.

**Styling & Responsive Design (30% AI Assistance)**
While the overall design system was manually crafted, AI assistance proved valuable for generating Tailwind CSS class combinations for complex responsive layouts. Copilot helped optimize the grid layouts for different screen sizes and suggested accessible color combinations for the dark/light theme implementation.

**TypeScript Integration (50% AI Assistance)**
AI was instrumental in creating comprehensive type definitions and ensuring type safety throughout the application. The complex filter state management and chart data transformations benefited greatly from AI-suggested type guards and utility functions, resulting in a more robust and maintainable codebase.

This AI-assisted approach reduced development time by approximately 35% while maintaining high code quality and consistency. The combination of human architectural decisions with AI-powered implementation details created an efficient development workflow that balanced creativity with productivity.
